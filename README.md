Raw, unfinished, second Django project. If you see it, know that I do not vouch for your life. Will I complete the project? NO. Why? There was little experience, there was little time, the idea itself and the topic were not interesting. The only thing, I will add is automatically added pages when creating a new article in the admin panel. This project has more unnecessary code.
